    <h1>IFP Similarity</h1>
    <p><em>In the plot below, each dot represents an IFP. The position of each IFP is determined based upon its similarity with the other IFPs. IFPs that are more similar will be placed closer together, and IFPs that are less similar are placed farther apart.</em></p>
    <p><em>Similarity is determined by 2 main factors. First, similarity is determined based upon how well each IFP matches the IFP taxonomy. Second, it is based upon the words that appear in the IFP question.</em></p>

    <p><em>Clicking an IFP will show the <span id='topn'>5</span> most similar IFPs on the right. Zooming can be performed with the scroll wheel.</em></p>
